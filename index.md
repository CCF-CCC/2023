The CCF Customized Computing Challenge is held by the China Computer Federation which aims to explore talents in computer architecture, stimulate students' interest in computer architecture research, and cultivate students' innovative spirit. The goal of this year's competition is to exploit the VLIW, SIMD vector processing capabilities of AI Engine in DSP and vision field. Contestants will compete to create the best performing design on AMD VCK5000 board. Grand cash awards will be given to the top three teams. The award ceremony will be held at the 2023 CCFSys Conference.

Highlights of this year's competitionï¼š

  * The hardware platform is highly optimized for computationally intensive applications with AMD's new high-performance accelerated core AI Engine array.

  * Learn the hardware architecture and kernel compilation methods of very long instruction word (VLIW) processors with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vector units.

  * Compared to traditional implementations of programmable logic, the AI engine improves the area computational density by a factor of three to eight, while reducing power consumption by a nominal 50%. At the same time, the C/ C++ programming paradigm raises the level of abstraction and promises significant improvements in developer productivity and hardware design capabilities.
  
  * Experience in depth a truly heterogeneous platform that combines AI engines (both vector and scalar engines), programmable logic (PL), adaptive engines (DSP), integrated DDR memory controllers, and programmable Network on Chip (NovC) to maximize programming flexibility and ease of reconfiguration

Design performance and design reports each account for 50% of the final score, and entrants are encouraged to propose ways to further explore architecture and development process optimization for heterogeneous platforms from a design and AI Engine architecture perspective.
